A simple web page that contains jobs scraped from the [University of California jobs website](https://jobs.universityofcalifornia.edu/site). 

There are some notable quality of life improvements:
- All jobs results in a single page instead of having to browse job results 10 at a time.
- Multiple category filters can be applied at a time.
- Jobs can be easily favorited without needing to make an account with each campus.
- It is easy to track jobs that were posted since your last visit.
